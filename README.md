# Critical Phenomena
### A collection of Monte Carlo simulations for several systems undergoing phase transitions.

Critical Phenomena (CP) are one of the most interesting aspects of Statistical Mechanics. The discovery of emergent behaviours like phase transitions, opened new scenarios in the Physics of twentieth century and are still today central in the scientific debate. Analytics solutions only exists for very simple cases and, usually, for 1D probelms. The computational tools associated to this kind of problems have undergone a great development through time, becoming the most powerful weapon to solve them and provinding new insight on the Physics behind them. Here I solved numerically, employing Monte Carlo simulations, some of the most famous Hamiltonians.
